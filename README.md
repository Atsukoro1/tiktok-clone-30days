# ðŸŽµ Tiktok clone made in 30 days

### Why ðŸ“œ
The concept of TikTok is relatively simple, but there are some things you can do to improve the final product. For example, you can add personalisation features using a neural network, or enable users to record and edit videos within the app instead of just uploading the final product. These small changes can make a big difference in the overall quality of the app. That's why I choosed this type of app, also I am including a lot of technology that I don't know so I'll learn it while doing this app.
